# Key problems and concepts covered include:

    - Permutations and Combinations: Generating all possible permutations or combinations of a given set.
    - N-Queens Problem: Placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
    - Sudoku Solver: Solving Sudoku puzzles by filling the grid using backtracking.
    - Subset Sum Problem: Finding subsets of numbers that sum to a target value.
    - Knapsack Problem: Finding the most valuable subset of items without exceeding the weight limit.
    - Maze Solving: Finding a path through a maze by exploring all possible routes.

## Each problem is implemented in both C++ and Python, demonstrating how to write efficient backtracking solutions in both languages:

    - C++: Offers precise control over memory usage and performance, making it ideal for handling complex, large-scale backtracking problems.
    - Python: Provides readable and concise syntax, simplifying the implementation of recursive backtracking algorithms.
